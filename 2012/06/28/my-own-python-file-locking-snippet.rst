`My Own Python File Locking Snippet`_

Having already written about the plethora of file locking libraries and
snippets, it only seemed fair to further muddy the waters with my own

don't run to better tested implementations, but only after letting me
know why what I'm doing is wrong. Thanks for reading any feedback
provided!
