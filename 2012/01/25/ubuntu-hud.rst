Ubuntu HUD
##########

I had seen an article on `Ubuntu HUD`_ recently and finally got a second
to actually read a little about what it does. The idea seems to take the
use of tools such as `Quicksilver`_ or `Alfred`_ and apply the same
workflow to menus actions in all applications. Overall it seems like a
slick idea. The video in the post above shows how it can be used on the
command line! Very nice.

My biggest question is that of discoverability. I remember when I was
working on the NLD 9 usability and felt the push for search was somewhat
misguided. Search is extremely powerful, but it is also something of an
art form. As a programmer, many times my goal in asking questions in
forums or on IRC is to gather new terms to help aid in my searches. When
you are a young programmer with no formal training trying to understand
how to work with files, knowing terms like "handle" or "EOF" can be
tough to discover on your own.

What is easy to appreciate in the HUD idea is that you never need to
leave your keyboard. This is the reason I'm enamored with Emacs. It
provides an interface to do so many things, that you rarely need to
leave the comfort of your frames and buffers. In Emacs the use of plain
text enables this sort of tool to work and I'd assume that GTK+ (more or
less) is what allows HUD to take things like menus out of the
application and add them to an index. If this assumption is correct, we
might finally see how a free platform has an advantage in providing a
better user interface. I doubt you could ever see such a widespread
conceptual change in something like OS X or Windows, partially because
it may not make sense to users, but also on a technical level it seems
really difficult.

No matter the long term effects, it is exciting to see some innovation
in user interfaces that reflect the maturity of the "computer" as a tool
that the majority of people use.
