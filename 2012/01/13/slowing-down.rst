Slowing Down
############

Speed is overrated and yet my mind thinks it is of extreme importance.
The extra few minutes spent triple checking some detail is agonizing to
my silly brain that simply wants to go go go. It is extremely
frustrating that the process of communicating ideas is rife with peril.
Just taking the words from my mind to my keyboard is a struggle at
times. Typos are just one example. My eyes look at what was written and
find the concepts I wanted to communicate instead of words that need
proofreading.

The one tool I know I have to battle this curse is to simply slow down.
Instead of the silent reading most do, I can read aloud to help improve
my comprehension. My own ears filter the cruft and make clear when an
idea is simply wrong. When I was a kid I took a test that suggested I
was an auditory learner, so my assumption is that by communicating
audibly, my mind gets a healthy does of reality.

Even though I recognize this powerful tool, my mind wants to avoid it in
the quest for speed. I need to slow down and speak clearly to myself.
This post is meant as a reminder.
