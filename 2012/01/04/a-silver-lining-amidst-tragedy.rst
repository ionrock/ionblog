A Silver Lining Amidst Tragedy
##############################

The new year brought a painful dose of tragedy in the loss of our friend
Esme. To learn more about what happened and to find information on how
to help `check out these words from waterloo records`_. Esme was a
really amazing person. She loved music and was an example of the kind of
person that makes all the hard work and money spent being in a band
completely worth it.

Losing someone is never easy as it creates a void. Something is missing
that you wish was still there. The experience is different for everyone,
but what is consistent is the mark left behind. It is safe to say that
Esme left a beautiful and deep mark on everyone around her.

It is this mark left behind that we can see some positivity within the
tragedy. People begin to speak up and share stories. Friendships are
grown and the community rallies. Some people find new meaning in what
they do and others make commitments beyond themselves. I hope that as we
reflect on our lost friend we do so with a desire to change how we live
today. Let great things rise up from the sadness we feel in the loss of
our friend. We as a community have already begun to react and while our
feelings are sad, `the actions`_ are becoming more powerful and spread
memories of a great person.
