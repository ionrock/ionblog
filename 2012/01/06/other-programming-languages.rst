Other Programming Languages
###########################

Recently I've found myself having a desire to check out some other
programming languages. It has nothing to do with Python being lacking
anything, but it just sounds like fun. When I begin actually taking a
closer look, my desire quickly fades away into the reality that learning
another language would be really hard and have very little benefit.
Python is a great language and no matter what other language I try,
heading back to Python always ends up being a beneficial decision.

If I did have a bit more motivation here are some languages I'd like
spend some quality time with.

Lisp
----

There are really tons of different Lisp dialects and runtimes. Here are
some more specifics.

Scheme / `Racket`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Racket is the new name for PLT Scheme. It provides a web framework.

`GNU Guile`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The blessed scripting and extension language for GNU systems. There has
been talk of rewriting Emacs using Guile, naturally, I'm curious.

`Clojure`_
~~~~~~~~~~

The Java ecosystem has some powerful tools that always are enticing.
Being able to write some service in Clojure and immediately reap some of
the benefits of years of VM fine tuning always sounds appealing. Getting
over the hump of the classpath and Java-isms always stands in the way.

`CLISP`_ (CL)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are some web frameworks in CL. The `window manager`_ I use also
can use CL.

`Haskell`_
----------

I've dabbled in Haskell here and there, but it never stuck. The static
philosophy is something I can definitely appreciate and functional
paradigms make sense to me. I think the syntax is where I lose some
interest. `Yesod`_ was a recent framework that looked interesting, but
not enough to lure me from Python.

`Go`_
-----

The other day I spent some time going through a more advanced Go
tutorial and had a nice time doing it. The problem here is that I don't
have any ideas of what to write. Again, Python always gets in the way by
being too easy.

C
-

I'm pretty dangerous with C now and would like to fix that. The larger
concepts like pointers make sense, but I'd like to learn it more
fluidly. Understanding the many tools surrounding C (autotools, make,
etc.) is of interest to me as well.

There are others of course, but these are probably the languages I'd
actually start spending time with sooner than later. Not long ago I had
a similar interest in asynchronous programming that I did managed to
satisfy. My conclusions then ended up sending me happily back to plain
old Python. With the exception of C, my guess is the same thing will
happen, but time will tell.
