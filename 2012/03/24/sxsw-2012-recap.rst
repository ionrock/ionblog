SXSW 2012 Recap
###############

It has been a week since `SXSW`_ finished up. A lot people ask us what
it's like to play "south by" as a local. I realize that it is probably a
lot easier than stopping through on a tour. When you are from out of
town, unless you got lucky with a hotel room, it is tough to have a home
base where you can get away from things for a bit. I'd imagine finding a
quiet place to park for an hour or two with some cold water would be
quite the luxury. As a local, the nicest part is we can go home.

The thing that makes south by hard is that you have no excuse to not
play as much as humanly possible. You live in town, you know how to get
around and you probably know many people helping to put on shows for the
folks out of town. Sometimes you can over commit yourself. Also, since
you are local, it is not as though you have a day or two to play. For
us, things start getting crazy during interactive and don't end until
Sunday, when many locals still play shows for other locals and out of
towners still hanging around.

Not that I'm complaining or anything. SXSW is always an interesting week
that leave me excited and totally exhausted all at the same time. Some
day I hope we don't have to play it and I can just grab my bike and see
bands.

This year was a good year for us. We were able to get two official
showcases and played some great parties, like Hotel Vegan for `Brooklyn
Vegan`_. We ate dinner with Anthony Bourdain. Lauren and Rachel were
able to play Subb's outside (I was at `PyCon`_). We did an interview for
Rolling Stone France and wrapped up the week hanging with `Thrasher`_.
It was a ton of work of course, but we had a great time.

This weekend we also headed up to Hot Springs to play `Valley of the
Vapors`_. Most people probably don't know this, but Hot Springs has an
amazing art community that the whole town supports. Both the promoters
and crowds do an amazing job making shows there tons of fun to play. It
was an honor to play the fest again and hang out with some old friends.

We are officially off the road for a bit, which couldn't have come at a
better time. Our yard needs quite a bit of love to get ready for summer
and I have plenty of 'grammin that needs to get done. This is the first
time after SXSW I was ever looking forward to being home for a while.
Usually spending the week at the festival I want to hit the road or go
in a studio. This time around I was definitely ready to stay at home for
a rest. I'm sure I'll get antsy soon enough for some van life, but for
the time being, I'm going to enjoy hanging around the house and getting
to spend time with our friends.
