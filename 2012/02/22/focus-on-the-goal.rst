Focus on the Goal
#################

My pet peeve recently has been people who want to do something great in
order to say they did something great. It is a dangerous mindset because
it diverts your attention from creating quality.

If your goal was to write the Great American Novel and you are
constantly focused on things like finding a publisher and artist for the
cover, then the chances of writing a great book taper off rather
quickly. If you want to write a great book, you need to spend time
writing.

This is especially frustrating when working with others. They are
concerned about moving their agenda forward instead of simply putting
out quality. Even though it seems counter productive at times, if your
focus is on the goal, the exterior details will fall into place in your
favor.
