Riding a Fixie
##############

This past Christmas I received a gift card to my local bike shop, `The
Peddler`_. Seeing as I had just gotten some new tires and bar tape on my
geared bike, it seemed like a great opportunity to start fixing up
single speed.

My single speed is a steel frame Panasonic Sport 1000. It is a pretty
typical inexpensive Japanese road frame. The fine folks at `Freeze Thaw
Cycles`_ built it for me. They specialized in building bikes from
scratch using used parts. It has always been a great bike. My only
complaint was that the gear ratio was a little too easy at times.

With some disposable funds to spend, and knowing that my wheels needed a
bit of work (some spokes had broken at one point and could probably used
a bit of love replacing the bad ones), I decided I wanted to get some
new wheels and a higher geared chain ring. They had a set of `blue
Retrospec deep v`_ wheels that came with tires and a flip flop hub.
Seeing as I've always thought the hipster fixie look striking, I thought
this was perfect. As for the chain ring, I went from 39 to 46 teeth.
They had to special order the chain ring and a lock nut for the fixie
side of the wheel, so I was able to ride around on the new wheels as a
single speed while waiting for them to come in.

My initial reaction was rather mixed. They were extremely smooth, but
also a lot stiffer of a ride. My old tires were a bigger, so obviously
it was going to take some adjustment. The brakes also were honking like
no ones business. After reading up a bit from every cyclists friend,
`Sheldon Brown`_, my pads seemed toed in just fine, although they were
off center. I centered things up and it helped with the squawking. The
rims were also unmachined, so I'm sure the pads wearing off the paint
had a lot to do with noise. On the positive side, the wheels were much
faster. It was trivial to get going fast enough where my legs would
start spinning due to the easy gear of my chain ring.

I had ridden out to the coffee shop next door to The Peddler,
`Flightpath Coffee`_, in anticipation of my new chain ring and lock nut.
They put the parts on right away and I began my first fixie ride back to
the house. Knowing it would take some getting used to, I took a back
road part of the way and spent a minute or two trying to do a `track
stand`_. It was definitely harder than I expected. I'm sure once I get
more familiar it shouldn't be too difficult. Learning to get my feet in
my pedal clips was also much more difficult than I expected.

Past the initial awkwardness, it was a ton of fun. The bike is silent
and the new chain ring feels great. I still have my brakes in case I
need to stop really quickly. Surprisingly, the brakes work really well.
My impression was that brakes on a fixie didn't really do much, but they
were just as effective as before. Having always had a desire to try out
a fixie, when I rode my single speed, I'd keep pedaling almost all the
time. This ended up being great practice and helped a great deal in
feeling comfortable.

I'm really excited to get out on the road. People say that riding a
fixie allows you to make a strong connection with the bike. Your body is
directly responsible for all aspects of starting, cruising and stopping.
I didn't really experience that just yet, but I'm hopeful that it is
something I noticed as I get more experienced.
