Some Thoughts on Agile
======================

I've recently started working under in an "agile" environment. There
are stories, story points, a board, etc. I couldn't tell you whether
it was pure scrum or some other flavor of "agile", but I can say it is
definitely meant to be an "agile" system of software development. It
is not perfect, but that is sort of the point, to roll with the
punches of the real world and do your best with a reasonable about of
data.

Some folks argue `agile is nonsense
<http://www.agileoverflow.com/t/why-do-some-developers-at-strong-companies-like-google-consider-agile-development-to-be-nonsense/107>`_,
but after using agile techniques, the detractors typically
don't consider using agile techniques as a tool and consider it a
concrete set of rules. No project management technique perfectly
compartmentalizes all problems into easily solvable units. The best we
can do is utilize techniques in order to improve our chances of
success writing software.

There are two benefits that I've noticed of using an agile technique.

 1. You **must** communicate and record what is happening
 2. You **may** change things according to your needs

The requirement to communicate and record what's happening is
important because it forces developers to make information public. The
process of writing a good story and updating the story with comments
(I'm assuming some bug tracking software is being used) helps guard
against problems going unnoticed. It also provides history that can be
learned from. It holds people accountable.

Allowing change is also critical. Something like Scrum is extremely
specific and detailed, yet as an organization, you have the option and
priviledge to adapt and change vanilla Scrum to your own
requirements. For example, some organizations should use story points
for estimating work and establishing velocity, while others would be
better suited for using more specific time estimates. Both estimation
methods have their place and you have can choose the method that best
meets your needs.

When adopting an agile practice it is a good idea to try out the
vanilla version. But, just like your software, you should iterate and
try things to optimize the process for your needs. It is OK to create
stories that establish specifications. It is OK to use 1-10 for
estimating work. It is OK to write "stories" more like traditional bug
reports.

It is not OK to skip the communication and recording of what is going
on and it is not OK to ignore the needs of your organization in order
to adhere to the tenents of your chosen agile methodology.
