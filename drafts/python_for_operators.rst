Python for Operators
====================

The other day `Bob
<http://www.aminus.org/blogs/index.php/fumanchu>`_ mentioned that he
was not as interested `PyCon <https://us.pycon.org/2015/>`_ as it felt
aimed more at "operators" rather than programmers. It was something I
can definitely relate with. The talks on Python language constructs,
such as generators or context managers, are rarely useful to me
anymore. The talks on specific libraries or frameworks typically fall
into two camps, tools I use already and tools I won't be using. The
rest of the talks are typically based on integrating different
technologies or deal with a generic idea that is aimed at the tech
community at large. This last group of talks tend to deal with
important topics such as diversity, which are always good to cover and
typically are excellent discussions that improve the community.

Basically, if I'm going to PyCon, it is not about learning new things
about the language or programming, but how to integrate or "operate"
systems, using Python as the tool. If you've been using Python for a
long time, it is understandable, that at some level, you're
interested in novel ways to use the language moreso than listening to
a story how someone else used Python within some system. For example,
early PyCons would have talks like "Python on X" where "X" is some
mobile phone, industrial hardware, robotics toolkit, etc. These talks
were interesting as Python was growing, but now that Python has been
somewhat established, it isn't novel to hear about using Python on the
latest microcontroller board.

I think Bob was right. I don't think it is purely a function of
having a lot of experience with Python. Rather, it is a symptom of
Python's maturity and where it fits within the industry at
large. Python is a great language because it is portable, integrates
with lower level libraries and has a reasonable runtime. This makes
Python a great interface language for different systems.

A great example of this trend, and not surprisingly, where Bob spends
the majority of his time now, is the PyData community. Python provides
an excellent platform for numerical analysis thanks to Python's
ability to integrate with low level libraries (numpy), while still
providing the language features and community (ipython) that makes it
a powerful platform on its own.

Interestingly, I find the "operator" focus of Python a welcome
trend. Lately, I've found myself increasingly fascinated by
"devops". The complexity of programs has become more and more
reasonable to handle. The process of optimizing code using interesting
algorithms is rare. More often, we need to consider scaling, using
existing systems in highly complex, orchestrated designs. Yet, among
all this complexity, the primitives and patterns we use are still
inconsistent and naive. There is innovation that is needed to present
normalization of concepts in devops that we've see in programming
languages in order to manage complexity. An "object oriented" or
"functional devops" provides a challenging goal that Python is well
equipped to tackle.
