======================
Electic Sheep and RFID
======================


I'm finally getting around to reading `Do Androids Dream of Electric
Sheep?
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Androids_Dream_of_Electric_Sheep%3F>`_. The
premise is effectively what would happen if we had robots that were so
real we couldn't tell them from actual living things. It is an
interesting problem. The methodology in the book for determining an
entity as an android is a test of empathy. The innovation that throws
a wrench in everything is the creation of a new type of android that
might be able to fake the empathy test.

While the book has been fun, the premise is a little annoying at
times. Why is an interview necessart at all? Just stick something like
an RFID chip inside an android and you're done. Obviously, as the book
was published in 1968, a future of RFID and GPS may not be at the
forefront of futuristic thinking. Unfortunately, that doesn't take
away from the fact that we do have things like RFIDs today.

Still, our reality is a minor annoyance. The book is still a great
read and I can recommend it to anyone who enjoys scifi.
