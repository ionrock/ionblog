 Announcing CacheControl 0.8.2! Now with ETag and Vary Support
===============================================================

I've released `CacheControl 0.8.2`_. Thanks to tow_ for submitting the
ETag support!

Take a look at the docs_ and specifically the way etags_ are
handled. I believe it is a subtle improvment over httplib2's
behavior.

Lastly, I've also confirmed the test suite is running under Python
3.2+. This is my first foray into the brave new world of 3.x, so
please open tickets for any issues or suggestions.
