Our Eyes are Modems
===================

I read an article about a new `retinal HMD
<http://www.roadtovr.com/avegant-hmd-virtual-retinal-display-hands-on-interview-video/>`_. Virtual
reality has never been a huge interest of mine, but seeing as I look
at a screen all day as a programmer, anything that could improve what
I see all day seems worth a look (no pun intended).

It occurred to me that the development of this sort of technology is
really similar to a modem. If we think back to early days of the
internet (it wasn't really that long ago in the grand scheme of
things) we had modems in our computers. A modem is a "MODulator
DEmodulator" and it took analog sound from the phone line and
translated it into data for your computer.

Our eyes act like a modem. We sense changes in light and translate
that to data. We then act on that data accordingly. Sometimes that
data causes us to blink while other time it stirs up emotions. This
last bit is why I believe most of these technologies focus on films as
an example use case. A movie is really a physical representation of
experiences as told through light. If a movie causes the viewer to
experience some emotions, it has effectively communicated it message.

I'm still on the fence as to whether this sort of direct analogue
connection to our brains is beneficial or just plain old scary.
