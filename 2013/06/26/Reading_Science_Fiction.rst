 Reading Sci-Fi
================


A while back some friends and I started watching "2001: A Space
Odyssey" as a bit of late night background movie. The last time I
experienced 2001 was enjoyable, even though I had no idea what
happened at the end. Yes, it was really cool and artsy, which appealed
to my subversive side, but beyond that, I was clueless.

This time around, I once again got sucked in and even though we didn't
finish it, I wanted to know what happened. A quick look on wikipedia
made me realize a father of sci-fi, Arthur C. Clark, had written the
screenplay and the book. There are criticisms that mention the book
ruins the mystery of the movie. Naturally, it seemed like a good
way to get the inside scoop, so I bought the book on my kindle app and
dove in.

Despite having an appreciation for the geekier side of life, the
sci-fi literature has never been a part of that experience. There
isn't a good reason for avoiding sci-fi books other than it didn't
seem very interesting to me. With 2001, that has all changed
dramatically and now I can't stop.

My path has been to visit the greats before descending into more
specific and lesser known authors. Here is a list:

 1. "The Sentinal" - Arthur C. Clark: A collection of short stories,
    including The Sentinal which inspired 2001.

 2. "Childhood's End" - Arthur C. Clark: Aliens visit earth, providing
    a catalyst for the next phase of evolution.

 3. "Rendezvous with Rama" - Arthur C. Clark: A really slow space
    thriller exploring a seemingly dead space ship.

 4. "Starship Troopers" - Robert Heinlein: A political discussion of
    the true cost for citizenship.

 5. "Ender's Game" - Orson Scott Card: There are two stories here. The
    first is Ender and going through battle school. The second, and
    probably more important for the rest of the series, is that of his
    siblings. Check it out!

 6. "Neuromancer" - William Gibson: A tougher read due to the creation
    of some native slang, but good nonetheless. This obviously spawned
    The Matrix movies. 

 7. "Old Man's War" - John Scalzi: Get drafted into the unknown space
    army when you're 75 years old? Loved it.

 8. "The Ghost Brigade" - John Scalzi: The continuation of Old Man's
    War. Again, loved it.

 9. "The Last Colony" - John Scalzi: The last formal novel in the Old
    Man's War. Once again, really great stuff.

 10. "Speaker for the Dead" - Orson Scott Card: Revisiting the Ender
     Quintet. This book was awesome! This is where the side story
     of Ender's Game comes the front and center.

I'm reading "Xenocide" by Orson Scott Card now, the third book in the
Ender Quintet. Once again, it develops the storyline of "Speaker for
the Dead". I can't seem to put these books down.

Besides the entertainment factor, reading sci-fi has helped me become
more excited about technology. Before I had read these books, news
about NASA and space stations seemed like a waste of money. Privacy
and publishing everything we do had started to feel like a weight
pulling down my desire to be online. Seeing the potential of fanciful
technology and excitement of exploring space has helped me rediscover
how technology can be cool. Seeing as I've been somewhat burned out
this past year, these stories have been a great tool in reigniting my
interests in programming.
