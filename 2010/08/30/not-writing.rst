=============
 Not Writing
=============

My writing has dropped off dramatically lately. This blog is not exactly
the brainchild of an extremely prolific writer, but it also isn't a
stagnant pool of text bit rotting on the web. So what has changed?
The first big change has been some of my responsibilities at work. The
project that was lead by my previous `partner in crime`_ has become more
my responsibility. This isn't really a promotion, but rather a shifting
of guidance and responsibility. Even though it has not been a huge
change, it is still change, which is rarely easy. Things have begun to
pick up as we've gotten a bit of momentum, but it is still an adjustment
for me.

The other big change has been less stark. There is some new music
coming down the pipe, but it is not without its share of blood, sweat
and tears. If anyone says recording a record is easy, they have never
done it. And if by chance they have done it, then they weren't
successful at it. If they were successful at making a record and still
claim it is easy then I don't know what to tell you other than they are
really lucky. This has been some of the toughest music to write and
record. We've been playing for a really long time and while in sense our
chemistry is pretty well solidified, it also feels somewhat too familiar
at times. That feeling isn't too much of a detractor, except, when after
you finish an exceptionally painful recording process the only feed back
suggests you have a lot more work to do and no money to do it with. The
details aren't terribly important, but it has been a really tough couple
months.

The good side is that we have some tours coming up and, as I said
before, we've gotten a bit of momentum at work. The goal is that some of
that momentum can be directed towards writing. Whether or not it shows
up on my blog is another question all together, but I'm sure that there
will be some more reflections and discoveries I'd like to share sooner
rather than later.
