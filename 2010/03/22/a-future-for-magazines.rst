========================
 A Future for Magazines
========================

The other day while reading `Spin`_, it occurred to me `Pitchfork`_
should have a magazine. It is not a matter money but rather a matter of
brand and more importantly scaling out the perception of being a taste
maker. Personally, I don't read Pitchfork as bloggers suit me better,
but that is the entire point. Different mediums provide different
contexts for communication, which in turn speak to different audiences.
When you are running a business that is based on advertising, eyeballs
are important. Scaling out that business then is finding ways to get a
larger audience.


I've always felt that social software often times simply makes an
effort to fill different types of communication. Sometimes you need to
describe things in great detail while other times a few words is enough.
There are also photos, videos and sound that have their place among
social communication. The social web is simply the translation of
communication subtleties to real mechanisms on line.


Now, how this translates to Pitchfork is that unless they are able to
transfer their branding to new markets via different kinds of
communication mediums, they risk losing their status as the music taste
maker. I say this because recently they did a redesign. Personally I
liked it, but what became clear was that their web prescience had become
more authoritative and respectable. The previous design was a little
sloppier and edgy. It portrayed a message of something abrasive and
different from the status quo. Now their brand looks like a catalog or
newspaper. They provide the facts instead of the future.


Changing the design marks the beginning of the end for Pitchfork unless
it continues to expand. Its initial medium of the web may simply have
become more receptive to the newspaper like message. But, there are
still those people who want the edgy and future based message. Pitchfork
should aim to keep these information seekers close if they want to stay
as taste makers. Likewise, if Pitchfork does want to expand into the
more casual music listener's world, something like a magazine might very
well be a great way to expand that market and brand.


I have no idea whether it is even feasible to start a new music
magazine in this day and age, but I think it is worth thinking about in
terms of audiences. There are still people who find music through music
magazines just like there are people who listen to the radio. There is
innovation on the way that will help migrate those people to other
mediums, which is why helping to push traffic to something like
`pitchfork.com`_ via a magazine is a good move. The goal is not to have
a successful magazine but to speak to those people stuck in the old
medium in a way to help them move to the new.
