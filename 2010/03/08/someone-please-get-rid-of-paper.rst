 Someone Please Get Rid of Paper
=================================

Printing has never been a large part of my life with computers. I
remember when I was `Novell`_ and we needed to print something in color,
there was puzzling amount of communication regarding how to get it done
that usually ended up in asking a mac user to print it. Sometimes eating
your own dog food is painful.

Recently at work I've had to turn in some hard copy materials. The
first step was to try and scan them. No dice there. Our printer /
scanner wasn't scanning (with OS X no less!), so I had to find another
way. My next option was sending a fax. Yet another troublesome practice
that forces me to go to `Kinkos`_ and spend money on a silly expense.
Did I mention that these hard copy materials are partially an expense
report? One might suggest that I simply "expense" the fax. The irony
here is that I'd have to send another fax with the fax receipt, but hold
for a second. That would be another fax!!! A truly vicious and far from
worth it cycle.

I hope that someday we won't need so much paper. I'm totally fine
dealing with real deal hard copy for things like contracts or other
documents that are valuable outside of the digital realm. But for things
like receipts and expense reports it just seems silly. Credit card
companies should let you pick a set of charges and sent a link to a
certified statement. They would be vouching that the expenses are real
and the SSL cert makes it verified. Expense reports could be a thing of
the past if there was a good way to verify and agree on digital
documents.

There has always been the idea of the digital signature floating
around. It never seems to catch on though. It might be a chicken/egg
kind of problem where there aren't enough users to validate a service,
yet no one wants to jump a service that is not really trusted. Some
might argue the government should step in but they shouldn't. Paper will
continue to stick around until we can find a way to put our mark on
digital documents that we can all agree on.

I think the real reason there hasn't been a digital signature success
story is no one knows how to do it the right way. If I knew what the
right way was, rest assured I wouldn't be blogging about it right now.
No, I would be looking for funding and start my search for the perfect
island to buy. My guess is that the real answer is going to be a simple
fiat system built around existing web services. Something like a seal
that folks like `PayPal`_, `eBay`_, `Amazon`_ and the credit industry
agree on for no other reason than to set the standard. On a technical
level, there won't be much past some libraries that do whatever
conversation with web entities. `OAuth`_ is probably good example of
transferring trust from one entity to another.

My hope is that we do start looking for ways to phase out our use of
paper. Eliminating it is not a good idea because bits are too easy to
flip. But if we can migrate some everyday requirements to something that
digital it would be helpful. It is pretty shameful that we still use so
much paper and that it is made from trees. I had a teacher as a kid
mention that part of the reason marijuana is illegal is because the
logging industry sees a major threat in paper produced via marijuana
plants. This argument seems fishy since we have hemp, but in either case
if there is a renewable process to get paper, it seems like a good idea
to go ahead and use it instead of using trees.

No matter what happens with our digital signatures and paper usage,
I'll most likely hear I should be a doctor thanks to messiness of my
signature (digital or otherwise).
