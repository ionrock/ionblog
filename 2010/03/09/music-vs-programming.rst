 Music vs. Programming
=======================

Last night I realized the biggest difference between programming and
writing music. It is pretty obvious when you think about it. The
difference is the audience. Both instances you are trying to communicate
something. It is never easy and rarely does it work perfectly the first
time. There is a ton of practice involved alongside a whole set of
tools. Both have artistic aspects that always seem to be based on some
mathematical concepts. But biggest difference is really the audience.
On the programming side of things you have an emotionless set of
components that epitomizes stupidity. Sure, you can make a computer seem
smart, but really that hunk of silicon and connections is about as dumb
as it gets. It is either on or off. As a programmer, your goal is to
make that big hunk of simplicity do something interesting and/or useful.
It is a huge challenge because you have to use language that is going to
be read by other programmers. This means there is a secondary audience
(think other folks in the band) who need to understand what the heck is
going on. The biggest problem on all fronts is communication thanks to
the horrible medium of 1s and 0s.

Music on the other hand is another extreme when it comes to audiences.
The listener is the person you write for. Your goal is not to tell them
what to do, but rather to relate to their emotions. In a way, you're
communicating how to actually feel! Likewise, you have a set of
musicians or a band that you need to communicate how to communicate to
the listener. If you've ever been in a studio where they are trying to
get sounds you'll quickly see the deconstruction of genre devolve into
hand gestures accompanied by dancing and random vocal noises. Again, the
problem is the medium of emotion that makes music such a horrible
communication method.

Programming and music are at two edges of the spectrum of
communication. When you are writing a song what you really are doing is
communicating. Sometimes that communication is focused on those around
you and other times it is meant for the masses. Likewise, when you
program you write for millions of x86 processors as well as the other
developers on your team. In both of these cases the language you are
given provides a huge challenge.

Working in a team can be challenging enough, but it becomes even more
difficult when the output is a really hard communication medium. What's
is interesting is that you do see similar arguments even though the
medium of music and code are so different. One would assume that in the
coding world data and facts would reign supreme, but programmers can
often become emotional about implementation details. Likewise, in a band
there are tons of times where emotions run high, but the vast majority
of the time it's simple repetition and counting parts or measures.

The thing to take away though is that at the core is communication. If
you are not communicating something to the audience, whether that is
your laptop or a few hundred fans, you are not really doing anything.
Effective communication is what spawns action. In fact action is really
one of the best ways to communicate and is what leading by example
really means. When you consider what you do in terms of communication I
think it helps to gain a valuable perspective on what is really
important. The focus shifts to others and that is always a good.
