 Getting Ready for SXSW
========================

Once again `SXSW`_ is coming up an we're getting ready. We're in full on
practice mode focusing on getting our songs extremely solid. In addition
to playing, we managed to get ourselves roped into helping out with a
day show. This was a first. The first step was getting sponsors. That
managed to work itself out at the eleventh hour. Our next task is to put
together a backline for the bands as many are from out of town and won't
be touring down.

Outside of the obvious logistics and preparation, we're getting ready
mentally. It is funny because last year we really had high expectations.
We didn't really think that we'd be walking out with mountains of record
deals or massive hype, but it did feel as though some opportunities
might come to fruition. This year, we had hoped to have solidified our
plans for immediately after southby (as we say in the ATX). There was an
assumption that we'd know what we were doing next in terms of a full
length, which meant that SXSW was not a critical event for us. Life is
never what you expect and things didn't happen as we expected. The
result is southby is once again an important event for us.

There is one thing in life that seem to be true. When you're planning
an expecting great things to happen, they probably won't. The best
example I have of this is how I met my wife. I was in high school and
gotten sick of wanting to be in a heavy relationship. The truth is I
hadn't been some sort of serious relationship or anything close, but in
my own childish high school way, my mind was made up to stop trying to
find a soul mate and just get to know people. Not a week or so after
making this internal decision do I meet my wife and the rest is history!
I've been happily married for 10 years, have had a blast and learned
more about life than I could ever imagine.

I think the lesson to take away when preparing for something important
like SXSW is that it is really just a few days and it doesn't define
what or who you are. Believe it or not great opportunities happen all
the time. It is not realistic to be maxed out all the time in terms of
readiness, so be realistic. This is the cliche "it's a marathon, not a
sprint" idea. The thing about cliches is that they often are painfully
true, even though you don't really want them to be. This year for SXSW
we're expecting to play some shows and have a good time. Things have
already been more exciting, so simply trying to be ready is the mindset
going forward. I have a feeling it will all work out in the end.
