 Foreign Films from iTunes
===========================

The other day we rented `The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo`_ from iTunes.
Lately, we've been using iTunes and Amazon quite a bit for renting
movies. Our track record for returning movies to the video store is
pretty abysmal even though Austin has a truly great video store in `I
Luv Video`_.

Our TV watching technology is pretty "old school" as television has
never been an integral part of our life. Our TV is a hand me down from
my grand dad and has begun to show its age rather clearly. To watch
shows or movies we just hook up the laptop and go full screen. Pretty
simple.

The problem is that when we watch foreign films (which is somewhat
often) iTunes seems prefer subtitles in white text. The Girl with the
Dragon Tattoo was a Swedish film, which means, surprise surprise, there
is a lot of snow. Another theme in the movie is collecting information
from text that traditionally is on a white background. The result was an
EXTREMELY difficult time reading the dialog. The frustration is hard to
express in fact. As we became intrigued by the complicated story line,
we'd hit a character wearing a white shirt and have to jump up try and
catch the missing pieces in the story we couldn't read.

You would think in this day and age of extreme usability we'd see a bit
more dedication to obvious issues. I've seen plenty of foreign films
with yellow text and that would have done nicely. It would also be
obvious to move the text to the unused portion of the screen. Yes, I
realize that is a hold over from my ancient television tech, but it
still is a decent option an application could offer. It would be a neat
trick to have the text change color according to the background, but if
the text was yellow, that would work too.
