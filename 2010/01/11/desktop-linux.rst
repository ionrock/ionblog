 Desktop Linux
===============

As a programmer, I've found using Linux on my desktop rather rewarding.
So rewarding I might consider stating Linux is ready for desktop use.
But, when I do consider claiming that Linux is finally ready for
relatives it dawns on me that I'm far from a good use case.

First off I use `Emacs`_. This is not a mild usage of the one true
editor, but in fact Emacs has become a daily tool that I'd say I can't
live without. Second up, I use `StumpWM`_. This is a tiling window
manager that is anything but user friendly. For instance, over the
holidays, family members would consistently become frustrated trying to
open a new window or web browser. Lastly, I'm a programmer! The vast
majority of things I do on my computer deals with basic text and not
much else. I've even started doing more basic web browsing in Emacs to
save a little time.

While using myself as use case is not the best measurement of
usability, it doesn't really end there when ranking the desktop
friendliness of Linux. One huge frustration of mine is sound. On the one
hand, there are a ton cool programs for Linux having to do with sound.
There are music players, drum machines, samplers and rather full
featured recording applications. Unfortunately, rarely do they work. In
fact, sound often stops working in Flash and doesn't start working again
unless I restart my browser. Say what you will of Windows and OS X, but
sound works pretty darn well.

Personally, I'm totally fine with Linux not being ready for the
desktop. It is only a matter of time really. The desktop is quickly
becoming nothing more than a web browser and a series of web service
clients. Linux will still need to seriously find a way to stop sucking
at sound and improve video, but I suspect that it will. The only
question then is whether it will even matter at that point.
