 Crash and Burn
================

Last night I tried to wrap up my tube stereo amplifier kit. I mounted
the board, connected all the transformers, added a power cord, a switch,
a fuse and put some banana plugs on some speakers. Things were looking
good and I felt reasonably confident it would power up and I could boast
about my extreme warm tones.


Unfortunately things didn't work out that way. When I flipped the
switch there was a nice hum. It sounded like a real tube amp, which
seemed like a positive development. No sparks seemed like a good sign. I
watched the tubes waiting to see a nice glow, but then noticed a little
smoke coming from the power transformer. I turned things off and saw one
of the coils started to melt a plastic shield around it. Somewhat
dismayed, I took it back into the garage and checked for obvious errors
on my part, clipped a few leads and tried it again. The same thing
happened.


I've started looking up the best way to debug the problem on different
forums. While I had hoped I could avoid getting too involved in the
actual science of resistors, transistors, capacitors and the like, it
seems I might need to get a little more serious about it all. This is
far from a bad thing, but it does mean I probably won't have my sweet
tube stereo playing our EP on vinyl anytime soon. Worst case scenario,
my wife found a good vintage stereo repair guy in town that I can
probably talk to about how to fix things up.
