================================
 Hopefully Posting With Twitter
================================

Today I took a minute to add automatically tweeting when I write a blog.
For whatever reason, I've been blogging more lately. The result is that
in my (totally biased) opinion, my writing might actually be helpful.
What better way to help promote my writing than through the 80+ people
who follow `me`_ on `Twitter`_!
It only took a few minutes before things seemed to be working including
using `bit.ly`_ for shortening URLs. The nice thing about this is that I
will be finally pointing my posts back to my own blog instead of relying
on whatever service it is I'm using (`Posterous`_ and `WordPress`_).

Personally, I'd like to consider it a testament moreso to the wealth of
great libraries available in Python than any real programming feat of my
own. That said, after not looking at my blog code for probably a year or
more, I'm happy to report things were really easy to follow.
