 An Interesting iPad Observation
=================================

With the release of the iPad, there have been an almost non-stop barrage
of blogs and articles suggesting the both the triumph and failure of the
machine. My take is that it looks like it would be fun to play with.

How's that for a review. One observation I've seen a few times if the
lack of Flash. This has been an annoyance on the iPhone since much of
the web depends on the pervasiveness of Flash to deliver content. On the
one hand, much of the Flash content on the web is advertising. While it
seems like shooting the web in the foot preventing ads with Flash, not
many folks miss seeing big flashing advertisements.

The connection many of these blogs make is that if this platform
continues to grow (the iPod, iPad, and iPhone), it will eventually have
an impact on the propagation of HTML 5. This is an interesting logical
conclusion to make, especially since Apple does have its own Flash
player that it has been shipping with OS X for quite a while. Yet, the I
hope that it is true. While I haven't been following HTML 5, the
reverberations of its features have become rather loud lately. There are
quite a few aspects that go beyond HTML as markup and set the stage for
a larger platform built on the DOM and Javascript. While it has appeared
the spec is rather prescriptive in what it specifies, there have been
some positive connections to things like Google Gears and jQuery that
make me think some of the features that are out of scope, actually make
a lot of sense. In end it really doesn't matter if the HTML 5 spec
defines things like background processes in Javascript as long as
something pushes the issue in a way browser vendors can implement it.
I have to agree that the big win with the success of a Flash-less iPad
platform is the continued openness of the web. The Flash/Flex RIA world
is enticing, but it's still extremely proprietary. It has obviously been
a huge challenge to find technology that meets the needs of the web
while still keeping the openness. Changes in Javascript have been
excellent and it seem HTML 5 is where that evolution continues and opens
yet another door for opening up the web as platform. Flash has been the
one proprietary platform with the web that has continued to keep a
stranglehold on rich content. HTML 5 allows a real choice when
considering rich media in the browser. Hopefully this observation the
iPad reviews have presented can become a reality and the web can have
another renaissance with rich media and interactivity.
