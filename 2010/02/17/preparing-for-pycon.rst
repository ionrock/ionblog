 Preparing for PyCon
=====================

With `PyCon`_ a couple days away I'm trying to get ready. Partially this
is doing things like laundry. But, mostly, I'm trying to get my mind
really focused on technology. One would think that since I'm a
programmer that it is really easy to get into geek mode and just geek
out on all the cool things going on at a conference like PyCon. The
reality is that it is a little harder than that.

In addition to being a programmer, I'm a musician. The thing that
stinks about PyCon is that it usually happens pretty close to `SXSW`_.
The result is while I'm ramping up for a serious geekout, my mind is
also thinking of a grueling 5 days of shows, meeting people and working
towards creating opportunities for the band. Since PyCon is a rather low
key event, it is easy to put more focus on my SXSW concerns than my geek
prep.

This year is a little different. For one, I started thinking about
PyCon earlier. This was actually really helpful as I have some concrete
plans as to things I'd like to work on for PyCon. I'm still searching
for a theme in terms of sessions, but that shouldn't be too hard once I
get my schedule card in my hands. Another difference this year is that
PyCon was happening before SXSW. Last year it was afterwords and I was
very much still in SXSW mode. This meant thinking about things like
record labels, managers and booking agents more so than the
`multprocessing`_ module and `NoSQL`_ databases. I still managed to
learn a great deal and come away with some great experiences, but this
year I'm able to make a much better effort to keep focused on geeky
topics.

I'm sure other people have had similar experiences where it is
difficult to get out of a certain mode. I know when I've looked for a
job in the past, that mode of searching for work, selling your
experience and skills and generally trying to network becomes addictive.
It is the same sort of thing at SXSW. You have high hopes important
people will come see you play, so you give them every opportunity
possible. It is a ton of work and rarely is that successful, but it
seems that every year there is potential so you still work hard and go
for it. Besides the hard work, it can be a lot of fun. You can meet some
pretty interesting people and see some great bands. Some shows are
really hard to get into, so it can be fun to find someone to get you in
or to find your own way to slip past the person at the door. There is
always a lot of free alcohol, although when you play all the time, you
don't really get that many chances to settle down for a cold beer.

Likewise, you never know who you'll meet at a show or in the street, so
it is best to stay reasonably prepared.

All in all though, I'm really excited about both PyCon and SXSW. Both
events feel familiar and more comfortable. This is probably the first
year I've felt this way. I'm not taking it easy by any stretch, but my
expectations are realistic and achievable. So, if you're going to be at
either (or both!) please drop me a line and lets grab a beer!
