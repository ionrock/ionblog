Being Sick
##########

It is pretty frustrating to be sick and work from home. There is a
subtle pressure to keep working even though you feel awful. After all,
it is not as though you need to get dressed up. You can't get anyone
else sick. It isn't that much work to be on your computer anyway. All of
that doesn't mean you feel any better. I thought I had fought it off
before tour, but obviously not. Tonight I'm hoping a good nights rest
helps turn the tide and break my fever.
