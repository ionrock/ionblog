Web UI Frameworks
#################

The web is an interesting place because it is both visual and text
based. The browser provides a middleground between text and what we see
with GUI toolkits. HTML 5 seems to expand this role closer in both
directions by providing more interactive tools along side meta data to
make documents contain more information.

My interests have traditionally been on the server side of web
development. JSON as an interchange format has been helpful in allowing
a simple goal of computing data and utilizing it in web applications.
REST based services utilizing JSON has become a welcome norm to allow
dynamic applications in web browsers.

What has always been missing for me personally are the tools to make the
UI look good easily and fully utilize a JSON data service. The idea of a
UI created completely in the browser has always been appealing, but
impelementing such a system has always been difficult. Fortunately, that
all seems to be changing.

In terms of making consistent, clean UIs, we have a wealth of CSS
frameworks to choose from. I've used `YUI`_ and `Blueprint`_ with some
success. More recently, `Bootstrap`_ from `Twitter`_ seems like a
promising option to get a great headstart on a nice interface. Most of
these sorts of tools focus on some basic defaults and patterns, but that
is often times extremely helpful when you're like me and your interests
are on the server side.

Another really interesting project that I hope to try is `Obviel`_. It
is basically a client side templating system that relies on JSON data to
fill in the content. This isn't an entirely new idea, but considering
there are plenty of options that perform this sort of function suggests
the idea is getting clearer and more concise. The issues that others
found in creating systems like this seem to be getting solved, which is
great news.

When I first got out of school I worked at a company that had an actual
desktop application. I wrote a few GUI tools in addition to working on
the actual applications. It was always fun designing a GUI, yet horrible
to actually implement it. The nice part was that almost all the basic
design questions were answered. You knew the colors and the menu
structures. You had a suite of widgets to work from and they all were
pretty consistent in look and feel. Actually implementing these ideas
was never trivial though, primarily because C# was complex and required
tons of code.

With web applications the complexity can live in the browser, the server
or both. The result being that there are more opportunities to contain
complexity. Fortunately, thanks to tools like the ones above, there
seems to be actual means of hiding more complexity along with tools that
help to keep the process consistent and simple. While I think many
people see more excitment in HTML 5 features like video and WebGL, I'm
personaly happy it is easier than ever to provide the services I enjoy
with clean, simple interfaces.
