Personal Stats
##############

I had an idea this afternoon. I'd like to compile a set of personal
stats. As a programmer it is probably a little easier since adding data
can be a bit more automatic. The idea is to basically keep a log of
things you get done and track them. Revolutionary, I know. Where I think
this goes differently is that instead of just marking things as done,
you are actually keeping track of more minuscule data. For example, if
you write, you keep a running total of how many words you've written,
deleted and a final count when you're done at the moment. The idea is
that you'd not only see a history of what you did, but you might get a
better insight into things like accuracy. A lot of typing tutors do this
kind of basic analysis, but taking the concept into more general aspects
might be really interesting.
Here are some examples:

-  How many complete articles did you read today vs. how many you
   started reading vs. how many your hovered your mouse over for second
   as though you were considering reading it?
-  How many files did you create vs. how many were created by your code
   vs. other code?
-  How much data do you typically save on your machine every day
   explicitly vs. implicitly (caches)

There is a whole ton of data that might be interesting to plot that
might shed some light into where you're really wasting time or
resources. Honestly this idea is probably a micro optimization to help
get more done, but it is interesting none the less. I'd wonder if
looking at the data what sorts of goals someone might create?
In any case, that was my idea.
