My Mechanic is a Hacker
#######################

Once again my van is getting fixed.  I'd traditionally be pretty
frustrated, but having a chance to get it fixed at home under reasonably
convenient circumstances makes me feel slightly better about it.

I also don't mind visiting my mechanic. He is an honest guy and most
importantly, he is a good debugger.

Even if you know nothing about cars,  it important to understand what
is tough about fixing them. Replacing parts is generally pretty easy.

What is much harder is figuring out what parts need to be replaced. It
takes a good deal of systematic troubleshooting, especially with so many
computerized components. Understanding the systems in addition to how
they are reporting data is nontrivial and takes tons of patience along
side a healthy dose of experience.

My mechanic is like an old school unix hacker and I really appreciate
that about him.
