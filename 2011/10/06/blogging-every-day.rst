Blogging Every Day
##################

I'm going to give blogging every day a try. Lately I've felt like my
communication skills have not been as sharp as I would like. What better
way than to practice.
I'm not promising huge insights, specific topic matter or anything else
that might put undue constraints. I'm pretty bad at keeping on
commitments like this, so I'm keeping it simple. My goal is to go 30
days in a row with at least one solid paragraph per day at a minimum.
Wish me luck!
