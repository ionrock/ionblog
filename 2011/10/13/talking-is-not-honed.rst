Talking is Not Honed
####################

I just read `this article on siri`_, apples new voice recognition
software. The article makes a point to describe our evolution of speech
as "honed", which is utter crap.

I can just hear it now, "Um phone? Can you, like see if that one bar is
still open? The one where that guy with tattoo on his face works?"

Language has definitely changed, but I wouldn't say its been "honed".
