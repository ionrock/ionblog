I Can&#039;t Sleep Right Now
############################

I'd like to take a quick nap but I'm parked outside some dorm room and
some guy is screaming the words to different songs. It is distracting
when I'm trying to sleep. But it is also inspiring.Â  We're playing a
show in the basement of the dorm. I hope this guy comes down, buys a
record and screams to our music. That would be awesome.
