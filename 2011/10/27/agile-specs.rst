Agile Specs
###########

Agile development methods typically don't mention specifications as part
if the process. You might hear things like user stories, but a
specification typically is considered territory for waterfall
methodology. This is really a shame because a spec is a great tool when
writing software. A good spec can help clarify purpose, known
limitations and define finite details that might be otherwise left
undefined. These sorts of constraints help to define what the big
picture really is for the software.
What makes a spec fit in well with agile practices is a reference
implementation that is developed along side the spec. As your spec helps
to define a larger design, the reference implementation helps keep the
unknown details in focus. When you don't have a reference implementation
it opens the door for massive feature creep and design of features that
are unnecessary. It is like trying to paint a picture with one big
brush. It doesn't work because you can only paint an enormous image with
no real detail. The reference implementation provides an opportunity for
detail, which means that while some system may become complex, it is
still manageable because you have the big picture in the spec and an
implementation that supports the design described by the spec.
My spec writing skills are not the best, but I've found it is worth it
to try and design up front. Just as comments have been an essential tool
for me to keep track of what I'm thinking when writing code, a short
spec is helpful logically working through the details of the
application. It also can generally morph from technical notes to
documentation, which is always helpful. One way software is like art is
that you can look at every day and still not grasp everything you see.
There are always small bugs or features that you may miss. A spec gives
you a cheat sheet for better understanding code no matter what
development method you use.
