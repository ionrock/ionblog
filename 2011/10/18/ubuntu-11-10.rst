Ubuntu 11.10 and Old UI Design
##############################

Over the weekend I updated my development VM to the latest Ubuntu
release, 11.10. The big change in this release is the `Unity`_ UI as the
default. My understanding is that the release prior also had Unity as
the default, but it was only enabled on machines that had 3D
acceleration.

My overall impression: I like it.

Long ago `Garret`_ gave me a quick demo of `Quicksilver`_ on the Mac.
`Beagle`_ was still the search engine of choice and apps like `Banshee`_
were very much in beta. It was the sort of tool that when you became
familiar with it could easily become indispensable. It was a theme that
we used at the time when we were redesigning the `Novell Linux Desktop`_
start button menu. The idea was that you'd get something very similar to
what Unity is doing now.

Fast forward to today and the world of mobile and it is interesting to
see how the ideas we were building off of have become more reasonable to
the masses. Now the app of choice on OS X seems to be `Alfred`_. Mobile
applications don't have a button so to speak but use a lot of the same
type of search technology but instead of finding things, it attempts to
help complete thoughts in order to reduce the need to type.

Going back to Unity, what I like is that the concepts of Quicksilver
and Alfred are first class citizens. I also like how the maximize works
as it feels a little like the tiled window managers. The UI gets out of
your way and you can focus more on the applications.

I should also mention that because I'm using it within a VM, that I'm
probably not get the full experience. I usually only have 3 apps
running, Emacs (of course!), a web browser (Firefox) and thg (the
tortoise hg tool). All of these apps have their own models for
containing different projects and organizing their sub-content, which
might reveal why I care more about the UI of the application than the UI
of the shell.

On a side note, 11.10 sets Chrome (Chromium actually) as the default
browser. This is kind of funny because I had been using Chrome pretty
exclusively for a while, leaving Firefox. When Firefox switched over to
the short release cycle with its major release I gave it a try. I
dedicated a day or two to using it and the big feature that sold me on
it was the tab grouping. You can group your tabs and switch between tabs
via a keyboard shortcut that works kind of like Expose. The nice thing
about it is that I can once again start typing and it will highlight the
tabs according to my search terms. The result is that I can dedicate a
set of tabs for things like "work", "music" and "reading" and switch
back and forth as necessary using the keyboard. The grouping also allows
me to avoid distractions by keeping things like reader or social
networks on a whole other tab group.

I've always tried to avoid the mouse and while it is often the best
tool for the job, there is something to be said for finding better
models. Typing a word may not seem very efficient but I can type "fir"
and hit enter to pull up my browser without having to negotiate where my
cursor is or what icons are available. As we continue to evolve our
systems to include larger datasets and most likely more space for UIs,
having a way to be accurate may very well trump the flexibility of the
mouse and pointing.
