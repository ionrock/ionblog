OS Panacea
##########

You can't have everything. I updated my VM to use the latest Ubuntu and
while I like it just fine, it makes me want to delve deeper. I'd be
alright using it every day as that I what I used to do, but alas, OS X
is pretty darn reliable where it counts (network just works). The appeal
of flexibility is often trumped by the reality of quality. When things
just work it is hard to justify using something else.

*NOTE: I wrote this post yesterday. I've been feeling sick the past
few days and it felt like whatever sickness was waiting for me to push
myself too hard before kicking in with a vengeance. My conclusion is
that living like you are going to get sick is just as bad or worse than
being sick. So, yesterday Lauren and I hung out with friends, hence this
post coming a day late. I'm still on course for blogging every day for
30 days!*
