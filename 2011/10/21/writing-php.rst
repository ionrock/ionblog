Writing PHP
###########

`PHP`_ was my first programming language and set the stage for the rest
of my career. This is both a good and bad thing. I wish my experience
had a bit more compilation involved, but it didn't. I started with a
dynamic language that was special cased for inclusion in HTML.
Once I exited the world of PHP, I really didn't look back too often. I
had a couple scripts I maintained for the `band website`_, but that was
pretty much it. Recently though, I found `CASH`_ and it got me thinking
about adding some code to the band website.
It is interesting coming back to PHP after so long away. I can still
read PHP code, but that is a far shot from writing it from scratch. I
had to look up basic syntax like how to create a class and loops. The
whole public/private/protected paradigm was also rather awkward looking
and it seemed best to avoid it. One funny thing is that my `yasnippets`_
library didn't come with any pre-bundled PHP snippets. That was
surprising, but probably says more about the recent popularity of the
language.
The thing I like most about PHP is how simple it is to deploy. If you
want to do something dynamic in a web page (note the use of "page" and
not "application"), it is really hard to beat PHP. It is easy to find a
host, drop some files on a server and you're off and running. You don't
import code, you include or require it based on the filesystem. It
simplicity all the way and that is really refreshing.
One thing that was kind of a pain was getting MySQL set up. Fortunately
there are packages like `MAMP`_ that make the whole thing really
painless.
It is fun to try and write code in PHP after a long time away writing
Python (with a little C# and XSLT thrown in). It makes you realize that
much of programming has nothing to do with the tools. Solving the
problem ends up trumping everything, especially the language.
