Graphs and Stats
################

Seeing as I work for a company that does statistics, you'd think I would
be really good at it. Unfortunately, I'm not. It is an entire world of
math and formula that I have limited experience with have yet to have
requirements that force me to acquire that experience. What I do see
pretty consistently are graphs. I can say with the utmost confidence,
that graphs are not what statistics are really about.
A graph is all about communication. It is a visual representation of
some data that is meant to convey some relationship or lack of a
relationship. Graphs can be changed and manipulated to express
differences as huge jumps or radical contrasts. They can be used to
reveal real trends and find outliers. A graph is just a tool used to
communicate, which means it can be accurate or biased.
Statistics on the other hand are math, plain and simple. They are
formulas and theories that help take answers and calculate relationships
with specific understood precisions using specific constraints. From the
outside it looks like statisticians looking at graphs and giving their
thoughts, but really it is calculating values and adjusting
inconsistencies in order to put a number on some trend. This was a tough
thing to understand when I took stats in college. The class was really
all math and we were told very specifically how to phrase results. The
reason being is that stats is not about predicting or finding
correlation, it is about assigning values to results much like equations
are used to map things like sound waves and graphics.
I mention this because recently I've seen some graphs on social
networks with commentary on the results as though something has been
proven correct. One thing my experience at my job has taught me is that
statistical data doesn't prove anything. When I see graphs I appreciate
the communicative aspects,Â  but rarely do I trust the conclusions. I'd
rather see the stats.
