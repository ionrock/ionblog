Rash Communication
##################

Speed is an interesting thing. We often want to do things fast, yet
there is an inherent danger doing anything quickly. This goes well
beyond covering distances quickly. Going fast in anything can be a
prescription for danger... Or at least some mistakes.

My key example of an issue with speed is typing. I'm not a terribly
fast typist. What slows me down is not the speed at which my fingers hit
the keys. The thing that really slows me down is inaccuracy. I'm
incredibly fast hitting the delete key and probably use it more than any
other on the keyboard.

Another area that speed can be a problem is communication. No matter
how important it seems, saying the wrong thing is much worse than simply
taking a few minutes to properly craft an idea. I know this is a huge
problem for me. When I get an email with an idea that feels counter what
I was thinking my initial reaction is somewhat panicked. I want to
respond as quickly as possible how it is not right or some aspect is
being missed in the solution. It happens when writing songs as well.

I'll hear some effect or anticipate some feeling for a song and it is
very hard to put that aside to listen to how others hear things.

The key to stopping this rash communication is to listen. Often times
I'll go ahead and type like crazy making points and getting my initial
contrast out of my head. Then, when the typing starts to slow (this
happens b/c when you don't think about your message, you invariable will
ramble), I go back and start reading the initial message and rereading
what I wrote. The result is almost always a recognition that I missed
something. Assuming there is still a point I want to make (many times I
just throw it away b/c what I'm saying really didn't make any sense),
I'll continue to edit and eventually come up with something that isn't a
rambling mess.

I'm still learning to control my rash communication, but making a point
to listen has been key to overcoming my desire to blurt out nonsense and
understand what others are saying.
