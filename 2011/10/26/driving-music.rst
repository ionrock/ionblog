Driving Music
#############

I missed out on writing something yesterday because I a million other
things that needed to get done before we started driving north for a
short tour. Fortunately, Lauren grabbed my all time favorite record to
drive with, Sea Change by Beck.
The sounds on the record feel so warm and inviting. You can almost see
the musicians sitting around playing and watching each other for changes
in order to give each riff the perfect subtlety. There is a looming
sadness that adds to the warmth of each track that makes you want to
smile at the music and yet be completely silent in light of the tragedy
painted by the lyrics. The opening line of the record helps to secure
its space as a great driving record. "Put your hands on the wheel / Let
the golden age begin".
The other record we listened to was The Hunter by Mastodon. I've
listened to Mastodon quite a bit but not a whole album the entire way
through. Heavy music can be tough for long stretches at times, but The
Hunter does end up being pretty reasonable to listen to. The vocals get
really eerie and dark while not losing clarity. The subject matter seems
pretty typical of metal with things like blood and fire coming up pretty
consistently. What stands out more than anything is the drums. That
drummer never seems to play straight ahead. I kept listening for a beat
where it wasn't altered by a roll or rhythmic pause and can't remember
one moment. While this can be difficult at times to focus on, it totally
works. Eventually the rolls and misses merge together and spreads out
the sound of the song like a knife spreading a bit glob of peanut butter
on a piece of bread.
I have to be careful with driving music because it can get me thinking
about other things. Whether it is playing music or remembering some past
experience, if a song takes me somewhere it can make the actual driving
secondary, which is never good. Be careful on the road!
