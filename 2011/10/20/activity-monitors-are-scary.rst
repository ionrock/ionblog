Activity Monitors are Scary
###########################

Have you heard of `Usermetrix`_? They have a slick video you can check
out. The idea is that you use their library to see exactly how users are
using your mobile application. It sounds great. You know what steps
people are taking and what is causing errors. It emails everything your
customers are doing with your app so you can take that information and
make your product better. Everyone likes better products right?

Progressive is another company making an effort to understand their
customers better as well. `You can have a monitor installed in your car
that will tell Progressive how you are driving`_. Finally, all those bad
drivers out there will see that their poor driving costs others money
and you will see a huge discount for your attention to safety. Nothing
wrong with that. Right?

Wrong. Both of these ideas are ludicrous. The world is moving towards
more and more monitors in the theory that this expanse of information
will help make life easier. The fact is this information does nothing.
If you could just log interactions and find out what is wrong, then
software could feasible fix itself. Did you get a call that a family
member had been hurt badly and needed you to speed over to help? Well
guess whose insurance might go up. If it doesn't go up, then why? Aren't
they paying attention? All this information is rarely useable.

Most importantly though, these monitors inhibit privacy. Privacy is a
core tenant of freedom. The boundary created by freedom is worthless
without enforcing privacy. Should the government say, "Do what you want,
we just get to watch"? When you invite organizations to monitor your
every move, you are saying your freedom doesn't matter. The $100
discount you might save per year is worth handing over part of your car
ownership to an insurance company. The $1 app purchase is more important
than keeping your contacts safe. The gains you are making are trivial.
The people wanting these logs are lazy. Your privacy is worth more than
a few bucks.

This is why Open Source and Free Software are so important. When own
something, it is yours. Free Software is meant to protect your right to
use that computer as you see fit. Are people going to abuse these tools.
Of course. People abuse everything! That doesn't mean we should limit
everyone's access. Freedom is not perfection, it is a right. It is your
right to recognize opportunity, take on the risk and find success or
failure. By providing access to your life via these monitors, you are
only lowering the risk taken by the companies asking for the
information. They won't be able to use the information in a way that
truly benefits you. Just say no.
