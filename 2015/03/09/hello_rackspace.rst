Hello Rackspace!
================

After quite a while at `YouGov <http://yougov.com>`_, I've started a
new position at `Rackspace <http://rackspace.com>`_ working on the
Cloud DNS team! Specifically, I'm working on `Designate
<https://github.com/openstack/designate/>`_, a DNS as a Service
project that is in incubation for `OpenStack
<http://www.openstack.org/>`_. I've had an interest in OpenStack for a
while now, so I feel extremely lucky I have the opportunity to join
the community with one of the founding organizations.

One thing that has been interesting is the idea of the Managed
Cloud. AWS focuses on Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). Rackspace
also offers IaaS, but takes that a step farther by providing
support. For example, if you need a DB as a Service, AWS provides
services like Redshift or SimpleDB. It is up to the users to figure
out ways to optimize queries and tune the database for the user's
specific needs. In the Managed Cloud, you can ask for help and know
that an experienced expert will understand what you need to do and
help to make it happen, even at the application level.

While this support feels expensive, it can be much cheaper than you
think when you consider the amount of time developers spend becoming
pseudo experts at a huge breadth of technology that doesn't offer any
actual value to a business. Just think of the time spent on sharding a
database, maintaining a CI service, learning the latest / greatest
container technology, building your own VM images, maintaining your
own configuration management systems, etc. Then imagine having a
company that will help you set it up and maintain it over time. That
is what the managed cloud is all about.

It doesn't stop at software either. You can mix and match physical
hardware with traditional cloud infrastructure as needed. If your
database server needs real hardware that is integrated with your cloud
storage and cloud servers, Rackspace can do it. If you have strict
security compliance requirements that prevent you from using
traditional IaaS providers, Rackspace can help there too. If you need
to use VMWare or Windows as well as Open Stack cloud technologies,
Rackspace has you covered.

I just got back from orientation, so I'm still full of the Kool-Aid.

That said, Fanatical Support truly is ingrained in the culture
here. It started when the founders were challenged. They hired someone
to get a handle on support and he proposed Fanatical Support. His
argument was simple. If we offer a product and don't support it, we
are lying to our customers. The service they are buying is not what
they are getting, so don't be a lier and give users Fanatical
Support.

I'm extremely excited to work on great technology at an extremely
large scale, but more importantly, I'm ecstatic to being working at a
company that ingrains integrity treats its customers and employees
with the utmost respect.
